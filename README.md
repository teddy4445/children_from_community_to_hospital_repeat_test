# A Data-driven Guide for Repeated Testing in Pediatric Emergency Departments of Laboratory Testing Previously Performed in the Community

Laboratory tests for complete blood count, electrolytes, and C-reactive protein, conducted in the community for children aged three months to 18 years, were analyzed and compared with repeat tests performed in hospitals within 12 hours. The results of these repeated hospital tests were evaluated against the initial community tests. A repeat test was considered justified if there was an absolute change of 10% or more.
